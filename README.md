## Coursegraph

Coursegraph is a website that displays Georgia Tech's courses as an interwoven tree. It is designed to help current and prospective students visualize what classes they will need in order to take senior-level classes that interest them.

Inspired by my passion for graph theory and desire to learn basic Javascript, CSS, and HTML, I hope the Georgia Tech community will find this website useful.

I used the [visjs](visjs.org) library to display the graphs and the [Grouch]() API to get course data from OSCAR. Bootstrap was used to help design the website and the [jsonlab]() MATLAB suite to parse the results from Grouch.

Most of the Javascript can be found in /resources/js, the CSS in /resources/css, and the raw JSON data in /resources/json.
